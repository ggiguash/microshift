  # CNIPlugin is a user defined string value matching one of the above CNI values. MicroShift uses this
  # value to decide whether to deploy the OVN-K as default CNI. An unset field defaults to "" during yaml parsing, and thus
  # could mean that the cluster has been upgraded. In order to support the existing out-of-box behavior, MicroShift
  # assumes an empty string to mean the OVN-K should be deployed.
  # Allowed values are: unset or one of ["", "ovnk", "none"]
  cniPlugin: "none"
